> Note : Setup and Pre-requisites are a must, the mentors will NOT be helping you install go during workshop.

## Pre-requisites | Setup 

For linux :
```bash
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.19.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
go version
```
If after the 3 commands above, if you get the 1.19.1 version as output, you are good to go!

If you are on MacOS or Windows, follow [this](https://www.codecademy.com/article/setting-up-go-locally) link.
