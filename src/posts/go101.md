> Note : Setup and Pre-requisites are a must, the mentors will NOT be helping you install go during workshop.

## Pre-requisites | Setup 

For linux :
```bash
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.19.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
go version
```
If after the 3 commands above, if you get the 1.19.1 version as output, you are good to go!

If you are on Windows, download the [Go Installer](https://go.dev/dl/go1.19.1.windows-amd64.msi) and run it. 

If you are on MacOS, download the [Go Installer](https://go.dev/dl/go1.19.1.darwin-amd64.pkg) and run it.

## What is go? [Speaker-1]

## Why go and how it's similar to C? [Speaker-1]

## 01-The basic syntax  [Speaker-1]

## 02-An example, rather slow one vs what we are about to do [Speaker-1]

// Single threaded fizz buzz code along with time command

## 03-More about syntax [Speaker-2]

## 04-Concurrency

### What are threads, a very naive explaination [Speaker-2]

// Explain it to a 5 year old
Before we get started with concurrency, lets quickly skim through some basics. Try to answer the below own questions.
1. What is a program?
2. What is a process?

So, in layman terms    
* **Program** is a written set of instructions or syntax with some functionality which will be executed by the computer.
* **Process** is a program in execution.

* As seen in a computer, multiple processes can execute simultaneously and well that's multiprocessing.
* But the overhead and the work put on creating a process in any OS is quite heavy.
* We use **Threads** and the concept of **Multithreading** to achieve what processes and multiprocessing does but with lower overhead and much much more simplicity.
* So, What exactly is a thread?
* A **Thread** is an independent sequence of execution within a process.

* Lets take an example,
* Patty and Joe 
### Go routines [Speaker-2]

//This has to end with the question, how will these routines work together?
// Answer is channels

### Go channels [Speaker-3]

//The theory of channels

### The same example...just over engineered! [Speaker-3]

// Has to write code along
